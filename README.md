# Instagram-Unfollow-Checker
Tool for comparing and checking if anyone unfollowed you on Instagram using your own data archive in JSON.

## How to get correct data and result:

1. Log in to your Instagram account on a computer.
2. Download your Instagram data by following this guide: Download Instagram Data. (This usually takes up to 15 minutes, but sometimes up to 30 days.)
3. Unzip the downloaded data and navigate to the "followers_and_following" folder.
4. Locate the "following.json" and "followers_1.json" files.
5. Upload your JSON data files, click "Check," and we'll show you a list of users who are not following you back.

This tool may only be compatible with desktop/mac as you need to download data, unzip and upload again.
