# Instagram-Unfollow-Checker
A simple tool to compare your Instagram followers and following lists using your own downloaded data archive, and find out who unfollowed you.

## üì• How to use the tool:

1. Log in to your Instagram account on a **computer**.
2. Request your Instagram data in **JSON format** by following this guide: [Access and download your information on Instagram](https://help.instagram.com/181231772500920).  
   *Data is usually available within 15 minutes, but in some cases it may take longer.*
3. Once downloaded, unzip the archive and navigate to the folder called `followers_and_following`.
4. Locate the files named `following.json` and `followers_1.json`.
5. Upload both of these files into the tool and click **"Check"**.  
   You will then see a list of users you follow who don't follow you back.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This tool works best on desktop devices. It may also work on mobile devices that support file download and upload (most modern smartphones).
